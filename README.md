## Project Description

<!-- Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality. -->


Experimenting the use of multiple external API's from [Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/), [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/developers), and [Studio Ghibli](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com), this project is using vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Using JS's embedded Canvas and HTML Drag and Drop API, the project will add Giphy's gifs of Ghibli characters onto the canvas.

#### MVP

- Using Giphy's, Discog's, and Studio Ghibli's data to create a collage of dancing gifs of ghibli characters.
- Using the Fetch API for fetching resources: HTTP Requests, Responses, and Headers, along with a fetch() method for initiating asynchronous resource requests. (communicate with servers through the HTTP protocol)
- Render the API images on the page.
- Allow gifs to be dragged around using HTML Drag and Drop API, rendered on the Canvas (API).

#### PostMVP

- Allow users to save an image of the project, host or save it online.
